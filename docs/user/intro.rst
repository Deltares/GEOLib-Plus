Introduction
============

Philosophy
----------

GEOLib+ is a Python package that extends the GEOLib package with:
    - conversion from common formats, 
    - interpolation or interpretations 


Installation
------------
.. todo::
    Write installation guide issue: GEOLIBPLUS-47

.. warning::

    Note that installation of the GEOLib+ package and GEOLib with a python version 
    newer than 3.9 might lead to package conficts between the two libraries.
    And might require the reinstallation of a  few of those packages.
    This problem is using caused by version 1.6.2 of the pydantic package which is not compatible with 3.9 Python version.
    Upgrading to pydantic version 1.8.2 seems to solve this problem.
